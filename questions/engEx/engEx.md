| 1   | What is SCRUM?              | HIGH     |
|     | Scrum is a framework for project management that emphasizes teamwork, accountability and iterative progress toward a well-defined goal                      |          |
| 2   | SCRUM Roles                 | HIGH     |
|     | A Scrum team consists of three roles: the Scrum Master, the product owner, and the development team. While there is only one Scrum Master and one product owner, there are generally several development team members.                      |          |
| 3   | Ceremonies                  | HIGH     |
|     | The four Scrum ceremonies are:<br/>- Sprint planning.<br/>- Daily stand-up.<br/>- Sprint review.<br/>- Sprint retrospective.                      |          |
| 4   | Artifacts                   | HIGH     |
|     | The Seven Scrum Artifacts<br/> - Product Vision. The product vision is the long-term goal of the project or product. <br/> - Product Backlog. <br/> - Sprint Vision. <br/> - Sprint Backlog. <br/> - Definition of Done (DOD) <br/> - Product Increment. <br/> - Burndown Chart.                      |          |
| 5   | Agile Manifest              | HIGH     |
|     | The Agile Manifesto is a document that identifies key values and 12 principles that its authors believe software developers should use to guide their work.<br/><br/>The 12 Agile Principles<br/>#1 Satisfy Customers Through Early & Continuous Delivery<br/>#2 Welcome Changing Requirements Even Late in the Project<br/>#3 Deliver Value Frequently<br/>#4 Break the Silos of Your Project<br/>#4 Break the Silos of Your Project<br/>#6 The Most Effective Way of Communication is Face-to-face<br/>#7 Working Software is the Primary Measure of Progress<br/>#8 Maintain a Sustainable Working Pace<br/>#9 Continuous Excellence Enhances Agility<br/>#10 Simplicity is Essential<br/>#11 Self-organizing Teams Generate Most Value<br/>#12 Regularly Reflect and Adjust Your Way of Work to Boost Effectiveness                       |          |
| 6   | Scrum Cycle                 | HIGH     |
|     | A Scrum sprint cycle is a timeboxed period when a team delivers a set amount of work. It is typically two to four weeks in duration and each sprint starts the moment the previous one is completed. <br/>The Scrum sprint cycle is often referred to as a process of continuous development. It delivers a consistent work cadence for product releases and keeps the project’s momentum going until complete.                      |          |
| 7   | SCRUM Estimation            | HIGH     |
|     | Agile estimation is about evaluating the effort required to complete each work item listed in the prioritized backlog, which, in turn, helps improve sprint planning. Agile estimation is the process for estimating the effort required to complete a prioritized task in the product backlog. This effort is usually measured with respect to the time it will take to complete that task, which, in turn, leads to accurate sprint planning.                     |          |
| 8   | How do you estimate a task? | HIGH     |
|     | Planning Poker is an Agile estimating and planning technique that is based on an agreement from the team on the points being assigned to the Product backlog item. It makes sure that everyone participates and that every individual in the team shares his/her opinion.                      |          |
| 9   | Testing Pyramid             | HIGH     |
|     | Test automation pyramid consists of three levels:<br/>-`Unit Tests` - form the foundation of the test automation pyramid. The unit test layer is where much of the testing will take place and is normally written by the developer to verify the code they have written<br/>-`Integration Tests` - are crucial to ensuring that software performs as expected. Unit tests check small portions of code, while integration tests ensure that the software communicates efficiently with external components such as APIs and databases.<br/>-`End to end Tests` - takes the longest to complete and is the most expensive to maintain. It simulates real-world functionality by using a test environment and data, so it has the slowest operating pace.                      |          |
| 10  | Unit Tests                  | HIGH     |
|     | `Unit Tests` - form the foundation of the test automation pyramid. The unit test layer is where much of the testing will take place and is normally written by the developer to verify the code they have written                      |          |
| 11  | Design Patterns. Definition | HIGH     |
|     | Design Patterns are models of code that solve classic problems. They are solutions to software design problems that you can find in a real-world application. A Design Pattern is not a code that is ready to be used in your application, but it is a model that you can use to solve a problem.                      |          |
| 12  | Benefits of Patterns        | HIGH     |
|     | Design patterns are a toolkit of tried and tested solutions to common problems in software design. Even if you never encounter these problems, knowing patterns is still useful because it teaches you how to solve all sorts of problems using principles of object-oriented design.                     |          |
| 13  | Creational Patterns         | HIGH     |
|     | - `Abstract Factory` — Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.<br/> - `Build` — Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.<br/> - `Factory Method` — Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.<br/> - `Prototype` — Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype.<br/> - `Singleton` — Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.                 |          |
| 14  | Behavioral Patterns         | HIGH     |
|     |  - `Chain` of Responsibility — Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request. Chain the receiving objects and pass the request along the chain until an object handles it.<br/> - `Command` — Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterized clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.<br/> - `Interpreter` — Given a language, define a represention for its grammar along with an interpreter that uses the representation to interpret sentences in the language.<br/> - `Iterator` — Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.<br/> - `Mediator` — Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. Mediator promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly, and it lets you vary their interaction independently.<br/> - `Memento` — Without violating encapsulation, capture and externalize an object’s internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later.<br/> - `Observer` — Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.<br/> - `State` — Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.<br/> - `Strategy` — Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.<br/> - `Template Method` — Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm’s structure.<br/> - `Visitor` — Represent an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure. Visitor lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.                      |          |
| 15  | SOLID Principles            | HIGH     |
|     | The following five concepts make up our SOLID principles: <br/> - `Single Responsibility`<br/> - `Open/Closed`<br/> - `Liskov Substitution`<br/> - `Interface Segregation`<br/> - `Dependency Inversion`                      |          |
| 16  | CI/CD/CD                    | HIGH     |
|     | `Continuous integration` Developers practicing continuous integration merge their changes back to the main branch as often as possible. The developer's changes are validated by creating a build and running automated tests against the build. By doing so, you avoid integration challenges that can happen when waiting for release day to merge changes into the release branch. <br/><br/> `Continuous delivery` is an extension of continuous integration since it automatically deploys all code changes to a testing and/or production environment after the build stage. This means that on top of automated testing, you have an automated release process and you can deploy your application any time by clicking a button.Continuous deployment<br/><br/>`Continuous deployment` goes one step further than continuous delivery. With this practice, every change that passes all stages of your production pipeline is released to your customers. There's no human intervention, and only a failed test will prevent a new change to be deployed to production.                      |          |
