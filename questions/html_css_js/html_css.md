|       | **1** | **HTML**                                                                                                                                                                               |          |
| 1     | 1.1   | What is Critical Rendering Path?                                                                                                                                                       | High     |
|       | 1.1   | Optimizing for performance is all about understanding what happens in these intermediate steps between receiving the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript bytes and the required processing to turn them into rendered pixels - that's the critical rendering path. <br/><br/> The document object model is created as the HTML is parsed. <br/><br/>The HTML may request JavaScript, which may, in turn, alter the DOM. <br/><br/>The HTML includes or makes requests for styles, which in turn builds the CSS object model. <br/><br/>The browser engine combines the two to create the Render Tree. Layout determines the size and location of everything on the page. <br/><br/>Once layout is determined, pixels are painted to the screen.                                                                                                                                                                           |          |
| 2     | 1.2   | How can I get indexed better by search engines?                                                                                                                                        | High     |
|       | 1.2   | Getting your web pages indexed simply means a search engine knows your pages exist. <br/><br/> Simply put, without being indexed, a web page won’t show up in search results. Indexing is the foundation for search engine optimization. <br/><br/>Publish Relevant, Authoritative Content <br/><br/> Update Your Content Regularly<br/><br/>Metadata<br/><br/>Have a link-worthy site<br/><br/>Use alt tags                                                                                                                                                                          |          |
| 3     | 1.3   | What is desktop first and mobile first design approach?                                                                                                                                | High     |
|       | 1.1   | The term Mobile-First means that when developing a website, we start writing the CSS for smaller viewport sizes first, and then use CSS media queries to alter the experience for larger ones (e.g: tablets or desktops). This approach follows “Progressive Enhancement” from lower resolution to higher resolutions<br/><br/> Desktop-First approach follows “Graceful degradation” from higher resolution formats to lower resolutions                                                                                                                                                                           |          |
| 4     | 1.4   | How to make page responsive?                                                                                                                                                           | High     |
|       | 1.1   | Responsive is when the layout changes based on the size and capabilities of the device. <br/><br/> Some steps of arrangement the content to fit the screen size:<br/><br/> max-width of 100% for images<br/><br/> using percentages, vw for the widths<br/><br/> use flex, grid or Multiple-column layout to arrange content <br/><br/> use media queries based on viewport size                                                                                                                                                                         |          |
| 5     | 1.5   | What are the building blocks of HTML5?                                                                                                                                                 | High     |
|       | 1.1   | The basic building blocks of an HTML document are, <br/><br/>Tags: An HTML tag is written between < and > brackets an act as a container for different types of contents. Each tag has its own specific meaning, and the same applies to the content within it.<br/><br/>Attributes: To provide some extra information about a particular element, attributes are used in an HTML document. An attribute is applied within the start tag of a particular element and contains two fields: name & value.<br/><br/>Elements: An element in an HTML document can be understood as an individual component of an HTML file. In more simple words, the elements are everything written within tags, including the tags, attributes and the contents.                                                                                                                                                                            |          |
| 6     | 1.6   | When should you use `section`, `div` or `article`?                                                                                                                                     | High     |
|       | 1.1   | The \<section> element represents a generic section of a document or application.<br/>It is a thematic grouping of content. <br/>The section element is not a generic container element.<br/> A section typically goes with a heading. <br/><br/> The \<div> element has no special meaning at all. <br/> It can be used with the class, lang, and title attributes to mark up semantics common to a group of consecutive elements. <br/>When no other element is suitable, the div element is used as an element of last resort. Otherwise, it leads to poor accessibility for reader. <br/><br/> The \<article> element represents a independent item section of content. It must have a \<h1> tag for title. <br/> Independent item section of content: forum post<br/>— magazine article<br/>— newspaper article<br/>— blog entry <br/>— user-submitted comment <br/> Content in the article element should be independently distributable or reusable.                                                                                                                                                                        |          |
| 7     | 1.7   | What are the semantic tags available in html5?                                                                                                                                         | High     |
|       | 1.1   | \<article>	Defines independent, self-contained content<br/>\<aside>	Defines content aside from the page content<br/>\<details>	Defines additional details that the user can view or hide<br/>\<figcaption>	Defines a caption for a \<figure> element<br/>\<figure>	Specifies self-contained content, like illustrations, diagrams, photos, code listings, etc.\<footer>	Defines a footer for a document or section<br/>\<header>	Specifies a header for a document or section<br/>\<main>	Specifies the main content of a document<br/>\<mark>	Defines marked/highlighted text<br/>\<nav>	Defines navigation links<br/>\<section>	Defines a section in a document<br/>\<summary>	Defines a visible heading for a \<details> element<br/>\<time>	Defines a date/time                                                                                                                                                                            |          |
| 8     | 1.8   | Why would you like to use semantic tag?                                                                                                                                                | High     |
|       | 1.1   | By adding semantic tags to your document, you provide additional information about that document, which helps in communication. Specifically, semantic tags make it clear to the browser what the meaning of a page and its content is and to the search engines to better interpret content                                                                                                                                                                            |          |
| 9     | 1.9   | What is accessibility? ARIA role means in a web application                                                                                                                            | High     |
|       | 1.1   | Accessibility is the practice of making your websites usable by as many people as possible. We traditionally think of this as being about people with disabilities, but the practice of making sites accessible also benefits other groups such as those using mobile devices, or those with slow network connections. <br/><br/>   ARIA is shorthand for Accessible Rich Internet Applications. ARIA is a set of attributes you can add to HTML elements that define ways to make web content and applications accessible to users with disabilities who use assistive technologies (AT). When accessibility issues cannot be managed with native HTML, ARIA can help bridge those gaps.                                                                                                                                                                            |          |
| 10    | 1.10  | What is the purpose of the `alt` attribute on images?                                                                                                                                  | High     |
|       | 1.1   | The required alt attribute specifies an alternate text for an image, if the image cannot be displayed. The alt attribute provides alternative information for an image if a user for some reason cannot view it (because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader).                                                                                                                                                                            |          |
| 11    | 1.11  | Define semantic markup. What are the semantic meanings <br/>for `<section>, <article>, <aside>, <nav>, <header>, <footer>`and when/how should each be used in structuring html markup? | High     |
|       | 1.1   | Semantic markup is a way of writing and structuring your HTML to describe its content’s structural semantics or meaning, not how it visually presents the content <br/><br/>A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer. <br/>Examples of non-semantic elements: \<div> and \<span> - Tells nothing about its content. <br/>Examples of semantic elements: \<form>, \<table>, and \<article> - Clearly defines its content.<br/><br/> The \<section> element defines a section in a document. A section is a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading." <br/>Examples of where a \<section> element can be used:</br>-Chapters</br>-Introduction</br>-News items</br>-Contact information <br/>A web page could normally be split into sections for introduction, content, and contact information. <br/><br/> The \<article> element specifies independent, self-contained content. <br/>An article should make sense on its own, and it should be possible to distribute it independently from the rest of the web site.<br/>Examples of where the \<article> element can be used:<br/>-Forum posts<br/>-Blog posts<br/>-User comments<br/>-Product cards<br/>-Newspaper articles <br/><br/>The \<aside> element defines some content aside from the content it is placed in (like a sidebar). <br/>The \<aside> content should be indirectly related to the surrounding content. <br/><br/>The \<nav> element defines a set of navigation links. <br/><br/>The \<header> element represents a container for introductory content or a set of navigational links. <br/><br/>The \<footer> element defines a footer for a document or section.                                    |          |
| 12    | 1.12  | Describe the difference between a `cookie`, `sessionStorage` and `localStorage`?                                                                                                       | High     |
|       | 1.1   | `LocalStorage`<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Web storage can be viewed simplistically as an improvement on cookies, providing much greater storage capacity. If you look at the Mozilla source code we can see that 5120KB (5MB which equals 2.5 Million chars on Chrome) is the default storage size for an entire domain. This gives you considerably more space to work with than a typical 4KB cookie.<br/><br/>The data is not sent back to the server for every HTTP request (HTML, images, JavaScript, CSS, etc) - reducing the amount of traffic between client and server.<br/><br/>The data stored in localStorage persists until explicitly deleted. Changes made are saved and available for all current and future visits to the site.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>It works on same-origin policy. So, data stored will only be available on the same origin.<br/><br/>`Cookies`<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Compared to others, there's nothing AFAIK.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>The 4K limit is for the entire cookie, including name, value, expiry date etc. To support most browsers, keep the name under 4000 bytes, and the overall cookie size under 4093 bytes.<br/><br/>The data is sent back to the server for every HTTP request (HTML, images, JavaScript, CSS, etc) - increasing the amount of traffic between client and server.<br/><br/>Typically, the following are allowed:<br/><br/>300 cookies in total<br/><br/>4096 bytes per cookie<br/><br/>20 cookies per domain<br/><br/>81920 bytes per domain(Given 20 cookies of max size 4096 = 81920 bytes.)<br/><br/>`sessionStorage`<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>It is similar to localStorage.<br/><br/>The data is not persistent i.e. data is only available per window (or tab in browsers like Chrome and Firefox). Data is only available during the page session. Changes made are saved and available for the current page, as well as future visits to the site on the same tab/window. Once the tab/window is closed, the data is deleted.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>The data is available only inside the window/tab in which it was set.<br/><br/>Like localStorage, it works on same-origin policy. So, data stored will only be available on the same origin.                                                                                                                                                                            |          |
|       | **2** | **CSS**                                                                                                                                                                                |          |
| 24    | 2.1   | What are the possible ways to apply CSS styles to a web page?                                                                                                                          | High     |
|       | 1.1   | - `Inline styles`: (put style=”” right in the tag).<br/>- `Internal style sheet`: CSS style rules between \<style> </style> tags in the head section).<br/>- `External style sheet`: External file of style rules linked to the page with a \<link> tag.                                                                                                                                                                            |          |
| 25    | 2.2   | What does the cascading portion of CSS mean?                                                                                                                                           | High     |
|       | 1.1   | The cascade is an algorithm that defines how user agents combine property values originating from different sources. The cascade defines the origin and layer that takes precedence when declarations in more than one origin or cascade layer set a value for a property on an element.                                                                                                                                                                            |          |

|       | 1.1   | A CSS preprocessor is a program that lets you generate CSS from the preprocessor's own unique syntax.<br/>There are many CSS preprocessors to choose from, however most CSS preprocessors will add some features that don't exist in pure CSS, such as mixin, nesting selector, inheritance selector, and so on. These features make the CSS structure more readable and easier to maintain.<br/>To use a CSS preprocessor, you must install a CSS compiler on your web server; Or use the CSS preprocessor to compile on the development environment, and then upload compiled CSS file to the web server.                                                                                                                                                                            |          |

|       | 1.1   | Media query is a CSS technique introduced in CSS3. It uses the @media rule to include a block of CSS properties only if a certain condition is true.                                                                                                                                                                            |          |

|       | 1.1   | JavaScript libraries are an extremely valuable tool for any web developer. Adding simple animations can easily be done with CSS, but as soon as it comes to more complex or advanced effects, JavaScript is the better tool.<br/><br/>JavaScript:<br/>JavaScript-based animation delivers far more flexibility, power and better workflow for complex animations and rich interactivity, as JavaScript is imperative — you are able to programmatically define the animation — . Creating animations with JavaScript is, by comparison, more complex than writing CSS transitions or animations    <br/><br/>CSS:<br/>They’re easy to use for simple animations; you can start creating without the need of having to know about JavaScript.The animations run well, even under moderate system load. Simple animations can often perform poorly in JavaScript. The rendering engine can use frame-skipping and other techniques to keep the performance as smooth as possible. Letting the browser take the control of the animation sequence lets the browser optimize performance and efficiency by, for example, reducing the update frequency of animations running in tabs that aren’t currently visible.                                                                                                                                                                            |          |

| 14    | 1.14  | What does async and defer refer in script tag? Describe the difference between `<script>`, `<script async>` and `<script defer>` | Medium   |
|       | 1.1   | Browsers parse `script` tags this way -  Instead of continuing to parse once a script tag is encountered, the browser instead stops parsing, downloads the JavaScript, and executes it. This is why many times developers will put their script tags at the bottom of the HTML body so they do not delay the parsing of the HTML<br/><br/> `async` attribute when applied to a script tag will make the script tag work just like img tags to the parser. This means the parser will download the JavaScript in the background and continue parsing as normal without waiting. When the JavaScript is done being downloaded then the parser will immediately stop parsing and execute the JavaScript.<br/><br/>the `defer` attribute will not stop parsing to download the JavaScript. To create a defer script tag the following code is used \<script defer src="script.js"></script>. The parser will download the JavaScript in the background and continue parsing, but unlike the async attribute, the defer attribute will not execute the JavaScript until after the entire HTML document is parsed. This means that with the defer attribute the HTML parsing will never be delayed by the downloading of JavaScript. Also, since the JavaScript is executed after the entire HTML document is parsed the order of the JavaScript files is maintained. This is because all defer attribute JavaScript files must be downloaded before any of them can be executed                                                                                                                       |          |

|       | 1.1   | An inline frame (iframe) is a HTML element that loads another HTML page within the document. It essentially puts another webpage within the parent page. They are commonly used for advertisements, embedded videos, web analytics and interactive content.                                                                                                                      |          |

|       | 1.1   | `Noreferrer` is related to analytics and tracking. The referrer value shows the previous page where a user came from. By using the noreferrer attribute on a link, you are preventing other pages from seeing that traffic came from a click on your link.<br/><br/>`Noopener` is related to security. It closes a browser security issue called reverse tab nabbing which lets an attacker have partial access to the previous page and is typically used when a link is set to open in a new tab with target="_blank".<br/><br/>The `nofollow` attribute was used in the past to tell search engines to simply ignore a link. Google would not crawl these links and did not pass value through them. Their treatment of nofollow links changed in 2020 and now it’s more complicated. They treat nofollow as a hint, which means they can choose to crawl and pass value through them, or not.<br/>-Impact on SEO: it depends on whether they decide the links are valuable or not. There’s no way to determine which links they use and which they do not.                                                                                                                     |          |

|       | 1.1   | Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any origins (domain, scheme, or port) other than its own from which a browser should permit loading resources. CORS also relies on a mechanism by which browsers make a "preflight" request to the server hosting the cross-origin resource, in order to check that the server will permit the actual request. In that preflight, the browser sends headers that indicate the HTTP method and headers that will be used in the actual request.                                                                                                                      |          |

|       | 1.1   | The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.<br/>A web page is a document that can be either displayed in the browser window or as the HTML source. In both cases, it is the same document but the Document Object Model (DOM) representation allows it to be manipulated. As an object-oriented representation of the web page, it can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.                                                                                                                      |          |

The two-dimensional layout system here is perfect to create a complex design, we can use it in our favor to create more complex and maintainable web pages<br/>You need to have a gap between block elements: Another thing that’s very helpful in CSS grid, that we don’t have in Flexbox, is the gap property. We can define the gap between our rows or columns very easily, without having to use the margin property, which can cause some side effects especially if we’re working with many breakpoints<br/>You need to overlap elements: Overlap elements using CSS grid is very easy, you just need to use the grid-column and grid-row properties and you can have overlapping elements very easily. On the other hand, with flexbox we still need to use some hacks such as margins, transforms, or absolute positioning<br/>You need a layout-first design: When you already have your layout design structure, it’s easier to build with CSS grid, and the two-dimensional layout system helps us a lot when we’re able to use rows and columns together, and position the elements the way we want                                                                                                                    |          |

|       | 1.1   | BEM stands for Block, Element, and Modifier. It’s a CSS naming convention for writing cleaner and more readable CSS classes. BEM also aims to write independent CSS blocks in order to reuse them later in your project. Blocks are independent, reusable and usually bigger components of a webpage. They can have modifiers and contain elements. Elements are children of blocks. An element can only have 1 parent Block, and can’t be used independently outside of that block. Modifiers represent different states or styles of classes. They can be used both for blocks or elements.                                                                                                                    |          |

|       | 1.1   | The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content. Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear<br/>Padding - Clears an area around the content.

|       | 1.1   | The Flexbox Layout (Flexible Box) module aims at providing a more efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown and/or dynamic (thus the word “flex”).<br/>The main idea behind the flex layout is to give the container the ability to alter its items’ width/height (and order) to best fill the available space (mostly to accommodate to all kind of display devices and screen sizes). A flex container expands items to fill available free space or shrinks them to prevent overflow.<br/>Most importantly, the flexbox layout is direction-agnostic as opposed to the regular layouts (block which is vertically-based and inline which is horizontally-based). While those work well for pages, they lack flexibility (no pun intended) to support large or complex applications (especially when it comes to orientation changing, resizing, stretching, shrinking, etc.).                                                                                                                      |          |

|       | 1.1   | The CSS Object Model is a set of APIs allowing the manipulation of CSS from JavaScript. It is much like the DOM, but for the CSS rather than the HTML. It allows users to read and modify CSS style dynamically.                                                                                                                                                                            |          |
| 21    | 1.21  | Explain the difference between layout, painting and compositing?                                                                                                                       | Low      |
|       | 1.1   | Layout:-<br/>Browser will determine how much space each element takes up and where to place it.<br/>Painting:-<br/>This is the process of filling in pixels. It involves drawing out elements.<br/>Compositing:-<br/>Browser draws element to the screen in the correct order so the page renders correctly.                                                                                                                                                                            |          |
| 22    | 1.22  | What are the Benefits of Server Side Rendering (SSR) Over Client Side Rendering (CSR)?                                                                                                 | Low      |
|       | 1.1   | - Faster load time. A server-side rendered application speeds up page loading when the user suffers from a slow internet connection. Thus it greatly improves the whole user experience.<br/> - Easy indexation by search engines. As the content can be rendered before the page is loaded when rendering server-side, search engines can easily index and crawl it.<br/> - There are fewer issues with social media indexing. Social media crawlers, like search engine bots, have difficulty indexing JavaScript content. Client-side rendering is not supported by Facebook's Open Graph Protocol or Twitter Cards, for example. If social media sharing is an important part of your marketing strategy, server-side rendering may be a better option.<br/> - Better in terms of accessibility. SSR apps are better suited for people who use older devices with less powerful CPUs because the server sends pre-rendered content to the browser. Because assistive technologies such as screen readers cannot always parse client-side JavaScript, server-side rendering is frequently recommended for SPA accessibility. So, server-side rendering helps efficiently load web pages for users with slow Internet connections or outdated devices.                                                                                                                                                                            |          |
| 23    | 1.23  | What is difference between Select and Datalist?                                                                                                                                        | Low      |
|       | 1.1   | Generally, both the tags are used for choosing an option from the given list. But the main difference between both is that in the \<datalist> tag the user can enter its own input and add that as an option with the help of the \<input> element whereas the \<select> tag doesn’t provide this feature.                                                                                                                                                                            |          |

| 38    | 2.15  | What is the difference between Pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements?                                                                                                                     |      |
|       | 1.1   | names ‘pseudo-element’ and ‘pseudo-class’ are actually implying. A pseudo-element is a ‘fake’ element, it isn’t really in the document with the ‘real’ ones. Pseudo-classes are like ‘fake’ classes that are applied to elements under certain conditions, much like how you would manipulate the classes of elements using JavaScript.                                                                                                                                                                             |          |
| 39    | 2.16  | How do you specify units in the CSS?                                                                                                                                                   | Low      |
|       | 1.1   | Absolute Units<br/> Units that are “absolute” are the same size regardless of the parent element or window size. Absolute units can be useful when working on a project where responsiveness is not being considered. <br/>px, pt, pc, cm, mm, in<br/><br/> Relative units are useful for styling responsive sites because they scale relative to the parent or window size (depending on the unit). As a general rule, relative units can be used as the default for responsive sites. This can help you avoid having to update styles for different screen sizes.<br/>% em rem ch vh vw vmin vmax ex<br/><br/><br/>                                                                                                                                                                           |          |
| 40    | 2.17  | What is the difference between class selectors and id selectors?                                                                                                                       | Low      |
|       | 1.1   | The Main difference between ID and class selectors is ID selectors are unique to each of the element on a webpage whereas Class selectors don't have to be unique. To be clear using ID selectors we can apply styling to a single element with that particular ID.                                                                                                                                                                            |          |
| 41    | 2.18  | What is the difference between the “nth-child()” and “nth-of-type()” selectors?                                                                                                        | Low      |
|       | 1.1   | Whether you use nth-child or nth-of-type will ultimately depend on what your goal is for styling. As a general rule, if you want to select an interval of a selector regardless of the type of element it is, use nth-child. However, if you want to select a specific type only and apply an interval selection from there, use nth-of-type.                                                                                                                                                                            |          |
| 42    | 2.19  | What is the difference between RGBa, HEX and HSLa?                                                                                                                                     | Low      |
|       | 1.1   | The Difference Between HEX and RGB<br/>RGB or Red/Green/Blue is another well-liked method used to define color properties in CSS. RGB color scheme is a three-channel format containing the amount of Red, Green, and Blue as an integer between 0 and 255. HSL, which stands for Hue Saturation and Lightness, is another way of declaring colors in CSS. Unlike in RGB, in HSL, both the Saturation and Lightness of a color can change. However, although RGB and Hex color codes are supported in most browsers, HSL colors are mainly supported in HTML5 based browsers.                                                                                                                                                                           |          |
